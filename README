    =head1 DESCRIPTION

    `ExtUtils::ParseXS' will compile XS code into C code by embedding the
    constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and
    creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those functions. The
    compiler uses typemaps to determine how to map C function parameters and
    variables to Perl values.

    The compiler will search for typemap files called *typemap*. It will use
    the following search path to find default typemaps, with the rightmost
    typemap taking precedence.

EXPORT
    None by default. `process_file()' may be exported upon request.

FUNCTIONS
    process_xs()
        This function processes an XS file and sends output to a C file.
        Named parameters control how the processing is done. The following
        parameters are accepted:

        C++ Adds `extern "C"' to the C code. Default is false.

        hiertype
            Retains `::' in type names so that C++ hierachical types can be
            mapped. Default is false.

        except
            Adds exception handling stubs to the C code. Default is false.

        typemap
            Indicates that a user-supplied typemap should take precedence
            over the default typemaps. A single typemap may be specified as
            a string, or multiple typemaps can be specified in an array
            reference, with the last typemap having the highest precedence.

        prototypes
            Generates prototype code for all xsubs. Default is false.

        versioncheck
            Makes sure at run time that the object file (derived from the
            `.xs' file) and the `.pm' files have the same version number.
            Default is true.

        linenumbers
            Adds `#line' directives to the C output so error messages will
            look like they came from the original XS file. Default is true.

        optimize
            Enables certain optimizations. The only optimization that is
            currently affected is the use of *target*s by the output C code
            (see perlguts). Not optimizing may significantly slow down the
            generated code, but this is the way xsubpp of 5.005 and earlier
            operated. Default is to optimize.

        inout
            Enable recognition of `IN', `OUT_LIST' and `INOUT_LIST'
            declarations. Default is true.

        argtypes
            Enable recognition of ANSI-like descriptions of function
            signature. Default is true.

        s   I have no clue what this does. Strips function prefixes?

    errors()
        This function returns the number of [a certain kind of] errors
        encountered during processing of the XS file.
